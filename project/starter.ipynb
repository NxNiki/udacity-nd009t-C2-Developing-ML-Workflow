    "In this next stage you're going to write and deploy three Lambda functions, and then use the Step Functions visual editor to chain them together! Our functions are going to work with a simple data object:\n",

    "You've reached the end of the project. In this project you created an event-drivent ML workflow that can be incorporated into the Scones Unlimited production architecture. You used the SageMaker Estimator API to deploy your SageMaker Model and Endpoint, and you used AWS Lambda and Step Functions to orchestrate your ML workflow. Using SageMaker Model Monitor, you instrumented and observed your Endpoint, and at the end of the project you built a visualization to help stakeholders understand the performance of the Endpoint over time. If you're up for it, you can even go further with these stretch goals:\n",

    "* Consider the test data generator we provided for you. Can we use it to create a \"dummy data\" generator, to simulate a continuous stream of input data? Or a big paralell load of data?\n",
